# Passive earning

On ECUP.PRO, users can passively earn tokens through the **farming** feature, which simulates a mining-like reward system based on your PC build. Here's how it works:

**‚úÖ Requirements:**

To enable passive farming, the user **must have a completed PC Build**. Without a build, farming is unavailable.

**‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:**

1. **Activate Farming**\
   In the user profile, the player can press the **"Farming"** button to begin accumulating tokens passively.
2.  **Token Accumulation**\
    Once farming is activated, tokens will accumulate **every second** based on the total power of the user's PC Build.

    **Formula:**

    ```
    Tokens per hour = Total Power of PC Build / 2
    ```

    This means a more powerful PC will yield more tokens.
3. **Claim Rewards**\
   After 3 hours, the user must return to the platform and press the **"Claim"** button to receive their accumulated tokens.
4. **Repeat**\
   Once claimed, the user can restart the farming process by pressing the **"Farming"** button again.
